## Icon Files

For the system tray icon, you need to provide:

- `icon.png` - PNG icon (256x256 recommended) for the system tray
- `icon.ico` - Windows ICO file for the executable

### Creating Icons

You can create your own icon or download one. Here are some options:

1. **Use an existing icon** - Download a Figma + Discord themed icon
2. **Create your own** - Use an online tool like:
   - https://www.canva.com
   - https://www.figma.com (ironically!)
3. **Generate from PNG** - Convert PNG to ICO using:
   - https://convertio.co/png-ico/
   - https://icoconvert.com/

### Temporary Placeholder

Until you add your icons, the app will use an empty/default icon. The app will still function normally.

### Icon Design Suggestions

- **Colors**: Combine Figma's brand colors (purple, red, orange, green, blue) with Discord's blurple (#5865F2)
- **Style**: Flat, minimalist, recognizable at small sizes (16x16px)
- **Theme**: Combine the Figma 'F' logo with Discord elements
